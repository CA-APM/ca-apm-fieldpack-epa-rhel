# EPAgent Plugins for RHEL (1.0)

# Description
This is a series of plugins for monitoring both the OS and application processes (specifically WebSphere Application Server).

rhelDiskStats.pl - gathers I/O statistics for mount points.  
rhelSar.pl - gathers per CPU/core statistics.  
rhelVmStat.pl - gathers memory and some CPU statistics.  
psWASforLinux.pl - gathers usage statistics from WebSphere processes.  

## Dependencies
Tested with CA APM 9.7.1 EM, EPAgent 9.7.1, and Perl 5.22.

##Known Issues
There have been discussions about the reporting of CPU statistics when running on System z | z/Linux. We are currently looking into alternatives to getting this information for your use.

# Installation Instructions

Follow the instructions in the EPAgent guide to setup the agent.

Add stateless plugin entries to \<epa_home\>/IntroscopeEPAgent.properties.

	introscope.epagent.plugins.stateless.names=DISKSTAT,SAR,PSWAS,VMSTAT (can be appended to a previous entry)
	introscope.epagent.stateless.DISKSTAT.command=perl <epa_home>/epaplugins/rhel/rhelDiskStats.pl
	introscope.epagent.stateless.DISKSTAT.delayInSeconds=900
	introscope.epagent.stateless.PSWAS.command=perl <epa_home>/epaplugins/rhel/psWASforLinux.pl
	introscope.epagent.stateless.PSWAS.delayInSeconds=9003
	introscope.epagent.stateless.SAR.command=perl <epa_home>/epaplugins/rhel/rhelSar.pl
	introscope.epagent.stateless.SAR.delayInSeconds=900
	introscope.epagent.stateless.VMSTAT.command=perl <epa_home>/epaplugins/rhel/rhelVmStat.pl
	introscope.epagent.stateless.VMSTAT.delayInSeconds=900

# Usage Instructions
No special instructions needed for DiskStats, SAR, and VMSTAT.

PSWAS requires that you know the tab location of the WAS application name in the 'ps' output. It is recommended that you speak with your WAS administrator about standardizing the location of that property to ensure consistent results. Adjust the value of '$psCommand' at line 19 of the program.

Start the EPAgent using the provided control script in \<epa_home\>/bin.

##How to debug and troubleshoot the field pack
Update the root logger in \<epa_home\>/IntroscopeEPAgent.properties from INFO to DEBUG, then save. No need to restart the JVM.
You can also manually execute the plugins from a console and use perl's built-in debugger.
